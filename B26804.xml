            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>AS I through a Meadow one morning did pass,</l>
               <l>when Flowers and Blossoms were springing;</l>
               <l>I hapned to hear a young Beautiful Lass,</l>
               <l>as she this new Ditty sat singing:</l>
               <l>Here's Beauty without any manner of Pride,</l>
               <l>I'd give forty shillings I might be a Bride,</l>
               <l>To have a kind Husband to lye by my side,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>It is a fine thing to be Marry'd.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Alass, I have used all manner of means,</l>
               <l>for tempting young Batchelors to me,</l>
               <l>For two or three Year I have been in the Teens,</l>
               <l>yet there is no Gallant will Wooe me:</l>
               <l>My passion with <hi>Cupid</hi> is daily at strife,</l>
               <l>So that I am weary of a single Life,</l>
               <l>I wish that young <hi>Robin</hi> would make me his Wife:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>it is a fine thing to be Marry'd.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I now am a Servant and Drudge like a slave,</l>
               <l>expos'd to all manner of Weather;</l>
               <l>But had I a Husband it then would be brave,</l>
               <l>then we might both Cuddle together:</l>
               <l>The Charms of my Beauty would surely invite</l>
               <l>My Husband, to taste of the pleasant delight,</l>
               <l>In-pleasure we'l spin out the long Winters night:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>it is a fine thing to be Marry'd.</hi>
               </l>

               <l>The Lass that is Marry'd, her Husband and she,</l>
               <l>enjoys pleasant Charms out of measure,</l>
               <l>Yet I am not certain what sport it might be,</l>
               <l>but sure it is some sort of Pleasure:</l>
               <l>But e're it be long I'm resolved to know,</l>
               <l>If any Good-Fellow some kindness will show,</l>
               <l>What causes this Itching, above and below:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>it is I dare swear to be Marry'd.</hi>

               <l>he'l hugg her, nay, kiss her, and squoeze her:</l>
               <l>Now when she doth find him thus frolick and free,</l>
               <l>In Love and Affection they both do agree,</l>
               <l>It makes her as blith as a Bird in a Tree:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>it is a fine thing to be Marry'd.</hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nay, when a young Woman is Breeding, you know</l>
               <l>the Husband with Dainties will feed her:</l>
               <l>And as it to higher perfection doth grow,</l>
               <l>abroad he will carefully lead her:</l>
               <l>And then whatsoever she'll covet or crave,</l>
               <l>The honest good Man he endeavours to have,</l>
               <l>Whereby he her timerous Longing may save,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And when the young Women do chance to Cry out,</l>
               <l>they straightways are call'd to their Labours,</l>
               <l>And then after this comes a Gossiping buot,</l>
               <l>to do as the rest of their Neighbours:</l>
               <l>They in their Apparel are Deck'd neat and fine,</l>
               <l>To prattle and likewise to tipple in Wine,</l>
               <l>Vntil all their Noses with Claret does shine:</l>

            <lg>
               <l>I hope in good time it will come to my turn,</l>
